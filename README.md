# Unique Integer Processor

This Python script processes a text file containing integers, filters unique integers within the specified range (-1023 to 1023), sorts them using bubble sort, and writes the sorted unique integers to an output file.

## Features

- Reads integers from an input text file.
- Filters unique integers within the range of -1023 to 1023.
- Sorts the filtered integers using the bubble sort algorithm.
- Writes the sorted integers to an output text file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file named `unique_int_processor.py`.
2. Prepare an input text file containing integers, one per line.
3. Call the `process_file` function with the appropriate input and output file paths.
## How to Run
1.Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2.Save the script and prepare the input file as described above.
3.Run the script from the command line or an IDE
you can use this code :python unique_int_processor.py

Replace "results_for_sample_inputs/sample_01.txt_result.txt" and "sample_input_for_students/sample_01.txt" with the paths to your input and output files, respectively.
